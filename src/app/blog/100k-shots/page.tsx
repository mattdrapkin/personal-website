                <p className='mb-6'>
                    This past weekend, I played in the Ivy League Club Basketball Tournament at
                    Harvard. As a senior, it has crossed my mind that I may never play basketball at
                    this competitive a level ever again. There’s lots to reflect on.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I don’t want to overromanticize my own life. I knew I was never going to make
                    the NBA. But basketball was the biggest part of my life up until college. I took
                    it more seriously than any other commitment. Aiming to shoot 100,000 shots
                    completely changed how I perceive the world around me.
                </p>
                <h2 className='mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>A Desperate Conversation</h2>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    After losing yet another game in my sophomore year of high school, I was sitting
                    in the front seat of Coach’s car. I didn’t want to talk on the way home. Our
                    record for the 2018-19 season was 3-19. What was there to talk about?
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I was fed up with a lot at that time, but one of the things that frustrated me
                    most was my own weaknesses. As a 5’11” unathletic guard, my opportunities on
                    offense were inherently limited. My ball handling skills could only take me so
                    far without the ability to elevate and play creatively around the rim.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Perhaps worse than my abysmal vertical leaping abilities was my jump shooting. I
                    shot 3/15 on three-point field goals that season. No athleticism and no jump
                    shot meant defenders could sit in the paint and easily contain any other
                    offensive threats I posed. It felt impossible to maneuver into the lane when
                    teams could easily pack the paint. Pump fakes and hesitation moves don’t work if
                    the defender knows the ball handler is a non-threat from range.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I had never been a good shooter, but I always had plenty of excuses ready, like
                    “My parents didn’t play sports, so I had nobody to teach me how to shoot.” I
                    lacked true accountability. I pitied myself.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Head spinning with frustration and doubt, Coach started talking about his own
                    playing days. He said he had some other guys on his team who were really
                    talented, so he knew he had to carve out a specific role for himself. As an
                    undersized guard, it made sense strategically to become a floor spacer with a
                    reliable jumper. He told me he spent one offseason shooting 100,000 shots to
                    improve his accuracy.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    It wasn’t that I thought Coach was the greatest shooter I’d ever met. I didn’t
                    even necessarily know that he was telling the truth. Counting each of those
                    100,000 shots itself sounds obnoxiously obsessive, let alone shooting 100,000
                    shots. But that was beside the point. This wasn’t a challenge to “make the extra
                    pass” or “stay disciplined on defense.” This was a challenge to work hard.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    It isn’t true that 100,000 shots is the only way to improve one’s jump shot. But
                    rejecting this challenge on the basis that 100,000 shots isn’t the optimal path
                    is a pretext for indolence. Nothing else I tried was working. Even if 100,000
                    shots wouldn’t make me an elite shooter, it sure as hell would make me a better
                    one— right? Just spending that much time, shooting 100,000 shots, watching the
                    ball travel through the air that many times, trying to perfect the craft:
                    surely, it would have to make me better. I couldn’t tell how much better. But
                    better nonetheless. Committing to obsession necessitates improvement.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>This isn’t just about basketball.</p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    That night, I begged my parents to get me a membership to the local rec. Then, I
                    made the below picture my lock screen, with a blunt reminder from Coach about
                    the season we just had.

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    From memory, I cannot confirm I followed through on each of the goals I set for
                    myself on the paper above. But I can share exactly how much progress I made
                    getting shots up specifically, because I tracked every single number. You can’t
                    improve what you don’t measure. I knew if I could look back and observe
                    objective metrics, there would be no excuses to hide behind.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Every day, starting on February 10, 2019, I tracked how many shots I took in a
                    single note document. This marks the beginning of my emotional journey of
                    creating something great.

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    At the beginning of the journey, I felt motivated. I committed to shooting only
                    inside the paint for the first few weeks so I could re-shape my jump shot, which
                    was cursed with a pretty nasty hitch. I was recording my workouts so I could
                    adjust my form towards something more closely resembled shooters I looked up to.
                    Shooting from close-range meant few long rebounds to chase down. It also meant
                    the ball went through the net a lot. Things were new. Things felt good.
                    Motivation was high.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Of course, motivation wavers. Discipline is necessary to build anything great.
                </p>
                <h2 className='mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>Dark Swamp of Despair</h2>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Discipline meant doing what I knew I needed to do, even on days I didn’t feel
                    like it. It sounds nice and inspiring when people talk about discipline like
                    that. But the truth is, it often feels like the opposite. It can really, really
                    suck. It feels good to know one is disciplined, but it oftentimes does not feel
                    good to actually be disciplined. It doesn’t immediately feel good to do the
                    things you don’t want to do.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    On March 7, I wrote “600 70%ft garbage.” Two days later, on March 9, I wrote
                    “470 two mental breakdowns one day.” I remember crying at the rec on multiple
                    occasions out of frustration. I remember crying after high school workouts where
                    I airballed open jumpers. I remember crying more than I remember the workouts.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    The next week’s summary: “2,347 shots not enough.” That’s over 335 shots per
                    day, without skipping, each shot chased down myself, and each attempt counted in
                    my head.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    What had started as a fun idea had led me down into a dark swamp of despair.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>Excessive? Maybe. Obsessive? Definitely.</p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    By March 30, I had gotten up over 18,000 shots since February 10. I missed days
                    sparsely (&gt;80% of the days since February 10, I got my shots up). It was
                    good, consistent work. But I was only a fraction of the way there.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    The challenge intensified in April, when AAU and high school ball overlapped:
                    Mondays and Wednesdays were AAU practice, and Tuesdays and Thursdays were high
                    school workouts. Weekends were usually AAU tournaments. I only counted shots
                    taken during individual workouts, not team practices or games. If I wanted to
                    maintain my high shooting volume, it would require the mental toughness to
                    squeeze in my own workouts around my team commitments.
                </p>
                <h2 className='mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>It Takes a Village</h2>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I was so focused. My jump shot had become so deeply intertwined with my identity
                    at this point. It was almost all I could think about. Days when I shot well, I
                    felt great pride. But days when I shot poorly caused me to question everything.
                    Am I wasting my time? Am I making a fool of myself? Am I in way over my head?
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Part of the pressure came from pursuing this project so publicly. My friends
                    were aware, because I couldn’t play pickup with them— I had to get shots up. My
                    family was aware, because they had to drive me around— I had to get shots up. My
                    coaches were aware, because I would stay in the gym after practices ended while
                    the rest of the team went to go get food— I had to get shots up.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>I feared public failure.</p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    With my mental fortitude wavering a bit into the month of April, it was the
                    ambivalence of others which pushed me to keep going. My brother frequently
                    offered to rebound for me. Soon, my friends did the same. Once people realized
                    how serious I was about my mission, I think I earned some respect. People didn’t
                    think I was in way over my head. They wanted me to succeed. I am forever
                    grateful for those few friends who acknowledged how badly I wanted it.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I was initially fearful of telling others about my goal, for fear of being
                    judged or ridiculed. But the more vulnerable I was about my mission, the more
                    people actually looked to help. I think this is true of life in general. I
                    sometimes overestimate how much others will judge me when making bold moves in
                    public, but discount how much others will be willing to help me. I wonder if
                    others can relate.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    On April 2, during one of my workouts at the rec, I was approached by a kid I’d
                    never met. He was the starting point guard at a private school near me— a pretty
                    good basketball school, unlike my own. He noticed my systematic workout and
                    asked why I was training with such intensity. I started to tell him my story.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Being a bit older than me, he told me how much he admired my work ethic. He told
                    me a bit about his own story and shared some tips that made him into a better
                    shooter. We exchanged phone numbers and agreed to get in a workout together
                    soon. Finally, he helped rebound for me until I hit 360 jumpers on the day.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Earning the respect of the starting point guard at an established basketball
                    program was everything for a 15-year-old Matt. Maybe I’m not crazy. Maybe I was
                    on to something.

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    That offseason, in addition to all the stress I felt on my jump shot journey, I
                    also dealt with the added stress of abandoning the AAU team I had played with
                    since the 5th grade. I felt I wasn’t getting the opportunity I deserved anymore.
                    With how much effort I was putting into my game, I decided to jump ship in March
                    to join another (less talented) team. It was an opportunity to continue to
                    redefine myself and take on the role of being a leader. One teammate from the
                    old team was kind enough to give his explicit support.

                    nervous before a game. I felt like I had so much to prove.

                    We ended up losing in a close one. But I led all scorers with 18 points,
                    including two 3-pointers and a number of pull-up midranges. After the game, I
                    received praise from family members on both teams, old and new, for how much my
                    jump shot had improved. One of the players from my old team texted me later that

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    From there, momentum continued to build in the right direction. A better jump
                    shot meant less mental breakdowns. It still wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. I
                    remember having to leave my birthday party early to get shots up while it was
                    still light outside. But in general, a self-reinforcing loop was created where
                    better shooting performance created more confidence, which led to better
                    shooting performance, so on and so forth.

                    By May 22, I had shot about 35,000 jump shots. That’s about 350 shots every
                    single day for about 3.5 months straight. I made time for individual workouts on
                    84% of the days within that timeline.

                    Input vs. output-oriented goals
                </h2>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I can’t remember exactly which it was, but one skeptical coach had a
                    conversation with me about my journey. They found it strange I was tracking only
                    total shots, and not made shots in my experiment. Tracking made shots, they
                    insisted, was a much better target. Making 100,000 shots in one offseason— now,
                    that certainly would transform me into a better shooter.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I accepted the original challenge back in February. I wasn’t going to shy away
                    from this one either. So I decided I would track only made shots until I reached
                    that illustrious 100,000 mark.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    On May 23, I started tracking makes. The problem was that it takes much, much
                    longer to make 100,000 shots than it does to shoot 100,000 shots. In fact, it
                    took so long that I wondered if anyone could achieve such a feat on their own.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I don’t have great documentation on why I stopped. But I do know that after two
                    weeks of trying to track made shots, my notes document terminates. My journey
                    ended abruptly.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Aiming to shoot <em>X</em> shots isn’t inherently worse than aiming to make{' '}
                    <em>Y</em> shots. They are different goals in nature. The former is
                    input-oriented, while the latter is output-oriented.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Output-oriented goals are more tightly coupled to the goal outcome (“I want to
                    make more jump shots, so I will go make more jump shots”). But they also can
                    induce more stress and frustration when output-oriented goals aren’t met
                    (“Yesterday, I made 300 shots in an hour. Today, I’ve been here for three hours
                    and I only just reached 100 makes. I hate myself”).
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Input-oriented goals don’t contain the same kind of guarantees that
                    output-oriented goals do. Even if I shoot 100,000 shots, I might miss every
                    single one of them. Then, I’m almost definitely not improving. But, with the
                    discipline to maintain attention to detail and chase a mark as high as 100,000,
                    the odds of improvement increase.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Here is how I thought about my goal: I will record my workouts. I will watch
                    them back to critique and iterate on my form. I will pick a north star number
                    high enough to require consistency and resilience to reach. If I were to track
                    only makes, my off days may totally derail my momentum. I may give up when I hit
                    a cold spell. (This is what happened in early June when I cut myself off).
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    But by tracking the total number of shots taken, all that matters is my
                    commitment. On the good days and the bad, the effort is what matters. If I stack
                    effort day over day, for months at a time, I am optimistic the power of
                    compounding will work its magic.
                </p>

                    My central hypothesis:{' '}
                    <em>
                        There is no way I can shoot 100,000 shots this offseason and still be a
                        terrible shooter. It is just so unlikely. Spending that much time working on
                        my craft must yield improvement, no matter how gradual.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2 className='mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>The results</h2>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I think my hypothesis was validated. Although I never made it to 100,000—
                    actually, I was only about 40% of the way there in the end— the consistency I
                    did display that offseason indeed changed everything about my game.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    My sophomore season, I shot 20% from three and only made three three-pointers
                    the entire year. My junior year, I led the team shooting 47% from three, making
                    more three-pointers than I even attempted the year before. My senior year, I led
                    the team shooting 48% from three, 48% from the field, and 85% from the free
                    throw line. I earned All-League First Team honors and All-County Second Team
                    honors. I led our team to our first league title in 20 years.

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    This attempt to shoot 100,000 shots was the hardest thing I have ever done. I am
                    grateful to be privileged enough to admit that. That means it was harder than
                    getting into college, harder than passing any exam, and harder than getting any
                    job or internship. I acknowledge and assert this fact.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Aiming for 100,000 shots taught me what it means to work hard. It taught me what
                    it means to have a growth mindset. It taught me that to do anything truly great,
                    things tend to get worse before they get better. It taught me that it is okay to
                    be different from the crowd. It is okay to get shots up while your friends are
                    playing pickup. It is okay to be misunderstood. It is okay to take the lonely
                    road.

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Any challenge I have faced since has paled in comparison. I face the world with
                    cautious optimism that <em>I can do anything</em> because I made it out of the
                    dark swamp of despair when I was 15-years old, shooting hundreds of shots in
                    empty gyms just to prove to myself it was possible.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Like I mentioned earlier about discipline, this process wasn’t fun in the
                    moment. The eventual success was worth it, but I don’t miss the days of shooting
                    100,000 shots. I missed parties. I missed times with friends and family. I drove
                    myself to some of the lowest lows I have ever felt. It sounds dramatic. But I
                    think when you fully immerse yourself in an uphill battle like shooting 100,000
                    shots, its par for the course.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I think everybody should experience some “100,000 shots journey” in their life.
                    Becoming entirely consumed by one overly ambitious goal for at least months at a
                    time. It is not just “setting goals” or “working hard.” It is becoming the
                    journey itself. The journey blends into your identity. You think about it when
                    you wake up and when you go to bed. You are all-consumed by chasing 100,000
                    shots.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Is shooting 100,000 shots the optimal path to becoming a better shooter? Of
                    course not. But many fall victim to analysis paralysis, searching for the best
                    way to do something, yet failing to act. Choosing to embark on 100,000 shots is
                    choosing to accept that the journey will be imperfect. Time will be wasted.
                    Mistakes will be made. Nonetheless, progress will be made in the right
                    direction. Perhaps, enough progress to turn you from a 3-19 team to a league
                    champion.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Because if you spend that much time and energy on perfecting your craft— no
                    matter how slow the progress— how could you <em>not</em> improve?
