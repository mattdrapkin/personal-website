                <p className='mb-6'>
                    When I was five years old, my mother read to me <i>The Kissing Hand</i> by
                    Audrey Penn. It was the only thing that calmed me down before attending my first
                    day of elementary school.

                <p className='mb-6'>I was nervous. Uneasy. Afraid of what the future might hold.</p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    This week, I graduated college. I remember my first day on campus with vivid
                    detail. My heart was beating out of my chest as we drove through Historic
                    Princeton. After fully unpacking in Walker Hall, I headed for the dining hall
                    for what was the most uncomfortable lunch of my life. I sat down for maybe five
                    minutes with a few of my new peers before telling them I had forgotten something
                    from my family.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    This was a lie. I didn’t forget anything. I was sweating. I was lightheaded. I
                    was so anxious about starting college that I wanted to see my family one last
                    time in hopes that they could calm me down. I was petrified.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Somehow, they helped me muster the courage to head back to Wucox to finish my
                    chicken wings. I was not naturally great at making new friends, so those first
                    few hours felt extremely lonely as I struggled to find the right words to
                    introduce myself to strangers.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>I was nervous. Uneasy. Afraid of what the future might hold.</p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    In many ways, I’ve grown over the last four years. My confidence in speaking to
                    strangers has grown. My confidence in my academic abilities has grown. My
                    confidence in my ability to lead has grown. There were so many unique
                    transformational moments at Princeton, it would be impossible to enumerate them
                    all.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    While I am truly proud of the strides I’ve made, I’ve come to an uncomfortable
                    conclusion since graduation.
                </p>

                    Living with predefined goalposts
                </h2>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Reflecting on my life, I’ve recognized that this bucket of emotions tends to
                    peak its nasty head during every major life transition— from elementary to
                    middle school, from middle to high school, from high school to college, and now,
                    from college to “the real world.”
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    These transitions are predefined for children. I never decided at the age of 14
                    that it was time to begin high school. That is just what adults decided for me.
                    For as long as I’ve lived, I’ve had these predefined cycles guiding me from one
                    stage of life to the next.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    As I move on from school, for the first time in my life, these sturdy goalposts
                    no longer exist. Sure, major life transitions can (and will) still occur.
                    Leaving a stable job to start something new. Moving into a new home. Getting
                    down on one knee and proposing. These are ambitions of mine which qualify as
                    major life transitions.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    But nobody will again tell me when to show up to graduation. Before, I have had
                    to encounter difficult emotions regardless of whether I felt ready. The time had
                    simply come. Now, it is up to me to decide when the time has come for a major
                    transition— and for the first time in my life, grapple with these emotions
                    voluntarily.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    This might sound like a very long-winded way of concluding that “change is
                    scary.” But I think there is more to it.
                </p>
                <h2 className='mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>Deep confidence</h2>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I am a firm believer that people cannot will their way towards confidence. You
                    can’t listen to meditative thoughts while you sleep so they seep into your
                    subconscious and reappear when you wake up. (I’ve tried.) “Fake it ‘till you
                    make it” only goes so far.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    People tend to assume that doing great things requires confidence. Many try to
                    scrap together confidence out of thin air to achieve their goals. “I’ll learn to
                    be confident, and then I’ll do the thing.”
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    But this is backwards. Even if you project confidence outwards towards the world
                    around you, when you go to sleep at night, and you are alone with your thoughts,
                    you will know whether or not you are deeply confident. Deep confidence is an
                    unwavering internal belief in one’s strengths and capabilities.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    The bad news is that deep confidence cannot be faked. The good news is that deep
                    confidence is a side effect, not a prerequisite, to doing something great.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    To acquire deep confidence requires jumping into the deep end with the unfounded
                    belief that you can achieve a goal without knowing a priori that it is actually
                    achievable. It must be a goal lofty enough such that if you had this achievement
                    under your belt, you’d have no choice but to be confident. “I’ll do the thing,
                    and then I’ll have no choice but to be confident.”
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I’ve done this by doing things I didn’t know were possible beforehand. For
                    instance, I lacked a great deal of deep confidence in my general intellect a few
                    years ago. But after graduating Summa Cum Laude with a degree in computer
                    science from Princeton University, it is hard for me to genuinely deny in myself
                    a level of reasonable competence.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Now, as I leave behind school and embark on a new journey in the professional
                    world, I recognize these familiar feelings. Nerves. Unease. Fear. But I know
                    that I’ve been here before. I know that these feelings are par for the course
                    when starting something new. I know I’ve overcome them before. And I know that
                    confidence won’t trump these feelings until I give myself no choice otherwise.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    I think this is worth acknowledging, because otherwise, I may end up waiting an
                    entire lifetime in hopes of finding “the right time” to act boldly. It may never
                    feel like the right time to start a startup, or pick up a new hobby, or carve a
                    unique path for myself. But I know that I won’t be waiting for the right time. I
                    won’t be waiting until I feel confident. And I won’t be waiting for feelings of
                    nerves, unease, and fear to subside.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-6'>
                    Every time I’ve experienced this devilish cocktail of emotions, it has followed
                    with a period of immense personal growth. If I manage to remain logical under
                    times of emotional duress, I’ll realize these feelings may precede another canon
                    event for personal growth in my life— and I will no longer have to wait for
                    predefined goalposts to tell me when it is time to grow.
